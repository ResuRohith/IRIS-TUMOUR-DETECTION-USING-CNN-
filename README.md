  Iris Tumor Detection using CNN

  Overview

The  Iris Tumor Detection using CNN  project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect tumors in iris images. This AI-powered web application offers a user-friendly interface for early diagnosis through advanced image analysis techniques.

  Features
-  Secure User Authentication:  Registration and login functionality.
-  Image Upload:  Allows users to upload iris images for analysis.
-  Tumor Detection Feedback:  Utilizes a CNN model for detection and displays results in real-time.
-  Responsive Design:  Ensures accessibility across devices.
